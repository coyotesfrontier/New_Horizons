{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DersoSrfLandedImpactSite = The surface here is covered in a dense glass-like substance created by this colossal impact, making a sample hard to get.
		DersoSrfLandedPeaks = You try to take a sample of the fine dust covering this area, but it just floats away before you can get it into the container.
		DersoSrfLandedLowlands = The samples here show an abundance of minerals and metals, probably brought here from the asteroids that smashed into the surface.
		DersoSrfLandedSurface = The sample of the ridges on the surface shows that this planet was once covered in these steep hills before it was demolished by the alpha impact.
		DersoSrfLandedHighlands = I'm sure the exposed stone in this area will provide valuable insight about the history and composition of Derso.

		DersoSrfLandedImpactSite = It's surprising that from down here the surface doesn't look like an eye at all!
		DersoSrfLandedPeaks = Sensors show the craft is ever so slowly sinking into the fine dust of the area.
		DersoSrfLandedLowlands = Sensors light up, warning you of the potentially dangerous area. Perhaps it would have been smarter to notice before you landed.
		DersoSrfLandedSurface = The original surface of Derso seems a lot more steep than you would've liked.
		DersoSrfLandedHighlands = The ground seems to shift around beneath the craft. You decide it's probably better to hurry up and leave.
		
		DersoInSpaceLow = You find the sight of the planet slightly less unsettling from here.
		
		DersoInSpaceHigh = You get the feeling you're being watched...

	@RESULTS
	{
		DersoSrfLandedImpactSite = You stand in awe at the enormous crater that stretches as far as the eye can see. This monumental moment is quickly taken away as you stumble and fall flat on your face.
		DersoSrfLandedPeaks = The fine dust of the area leaves deep imprints as you bounce around.
		DersoSrfLandedLowlands = You wonder if the impacts here were separate strikes or whether they came from the alpha impact that obliterated this moon.
		DersoSrfLandedSurface = Hills stretch on for as far as the eye can see. You suddenly wish you brought a sled.
		DersoSrfLandedHighlands = The area here seems the same as the surface, only slightly higher.
		
		DersoInSpaceLow = From here, Derso doesn't look like an eye anymore. You feel slightly more at ease.
		
		DersoInSpaceHigh = The sight of the giant eye in space gives you the chills.

		DersoSrfLandedImpactSite = Even the goo is awestruck by this area.
		DersoSrfLandedPeaks = The goo falls out of the cannister and quickly burrows into the dusty surface. You try digging for a while, but can't find it again.
		DersoSrfLandedLowlands = The goo calmly looks out at the surrounding area.
		DersoSrfLandedSurface = The goo twist around and somehow creates a perfect map of the area for you, how handy!
		DersoSrfLandedHighlands = The goo doesn't seem to like heights that much.
		
		DersoInSpaceLow = The goo seems to b biding it's time, you wonder what it's planning this time.
		
		DersoInSpaceHigh = Even the goo seems to be looking at you now.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DersoSrfLandedImpactSite = Experiments show the fused surface contains materials usually found on asteroids throughout the system.
		DersoSrfLandedPeaks = Dust seems to get everywhere through the materials, making the experiments useless.
		DersoSrfLandedLowlands = You contemplate doing the experiments, but find the idea boring.
		DersoSrfLandedSurface = Upon opening the doors, all the experiments tumble out onto the ground. Perhaps you should have secured them before leaving.
		DersoSrfLandedHighlands = You reach into the container and grab a snack. It seems replacing the materials with snacks was a good choice after all!
		
		DersoInSpaceLow = There seems to be a very fine layer of dust orbiting all around Derso.
		
		DersoInSpaceHigh = The experiments seem to be watching you. Is there anything around here that isn't watching you?

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DersoSrfLandedImpactSite = Residual heat can be detected from the alpha site, even after millions of years.
		DersoSrfLandedPeaks = The frosty coating on the thermometer tells you more about the area than the readout would.
		DersoSrfLandedLowlands = The depths of the craters seem to be a little warmer than the rest of the moon.
		DersoSrfLandedSurface = It's cold at the top of the hills, and at the bottom too! It seems this moon is very cold all over.
		DersoSrfLandedHighlands = From your observations you note that space is very cold.
		
		DersoInSpaceLow = Small fluctuations in temperature can be detected from the planet even at this height!

{

		DersoSrfLandedImpactSite = The super compacted ground here emits a stronger gravity that the rest of the planet.
		DersoSrfLandedPeaks = The gravity seems normal, you feel a little disappointed.
		DersoSrfLandedLowlands = Small fluctuations from the craters throw the reading all over the place.
		DersoSrfLandedSurface = Readings from the area allow you to estimate the original composition of Derso before the impact.
		DersoSrfLandedHighlands = You think the readings would be more interesting if you weren't the one who had to do the science.
		
		DersoInSpaceLow = Ridges from the planet can be detected as waves on the readouts.
		
		DersoInSpaceHigh = It appears something is wrong with the detector, you wonder if you forgot the batteries again.

		DersoSrfLandedImpactSite = Constant vibrations can be detected across the site, you lay down and get a gentle massage from the surface.
		DersoSrfLandedPeaks = The fluffy surface throws the readings off, so you just copy the other readings from earlier.
		DersoSrfLandedLowlands = Stable as a rock. A rock floating through space. That has been hit by another body.
		DersoSrfLandedSurface = You are unsure if you can detect geological activity in the planets core, or just rocks sliding down the hills.
		DersoSrfLandedHighlands = The only readings you detect are the wobbling of the craft from being on these steep slopes.
