		LeouchSrfLandedDecayedCanyons = Wow! This new abseiling rig is awesome!
		LeouchSrfLandedMainland = The tectonic activity down here makes life very difficult.
		LeouchSrfLandedFracturedLands = There is rock floating up from the surface, how odd.
		
		LeouchInSpaceLow = ExposedDepths = How am I meant to see anything with all this debris beneath me?
		LeouchInSpaceLow = DecayedCanyons = Wait, is that a cliff?
		LeouchInSpaceLow = Mainland = I want to go down there!
		LeouchInSpaceLow = FracturedLands = Debris, and lots of it.
		
		LeouchInSpaceHigh = Its very pretty.

		LeouchSrfLandedMainland = The samples shrink back into the bay, away from the harsh environment.
		LeouchSrfLandedFracturedLands = Some of the samples are glowing. It looks like it would be fun to *hissing* "stop! We've heard that one before" states mission control
		
		LeouchInSpaceLow = The materials seem to shake, you can't tell if it's from the moon or from fear.

		LeouchSrfLandedExposedDepths = Its so hot, you worry about the lander legs melting!
		LeouchSrfLandedDecayedCanyons = Plumes of heat are rising up from the canyon below.
		LeouchSrfLandedMainland = If this was a dry heat, it may be bearable
		LeouchSrfLandedFracturedLands = The temperature fluctuates around tiny volcanic vents.
		
		LeouchInSpaceLow = Large plumes of heat are detected in the cracks across the surface.

		LeouchSrfLandedExposedDepths = The instrument's reading fluctuate so much that it breaks.
		LeouchSrfLandedDecayedCanyons = Strangly, the gravity is sideways here, no wait, you are.
		LeouchSrfLandedMainland = The gravity here is very low, lower than an average body should be.
		LeouchSrfLandedFracturedLands = The gravity is a bit higher here.
		
		LeouchInSpaceLow = ExposedDepths = The field is significantly lower here. surely the instrument must be malfunctioning.
		LeouchInSpaceLow = DecayedCanyons = The field lines are coming slightly from the side. As it isn't Jeb reporting this, it might actually be true.
		LeouchInSpaceLow = Mainland = The sensor is picking up the gravity field.
		LeouchInSpaceLow = FracturedLands = Variances in the field allow the scientists at KSC to create a map of Leouch's innards.
		
		LeouchInSpaceHigh = ExposedDepths = The gravity dips slightly, most likely from the loss of mass from the surface.
		LeouchInSpaceHigh = DecayedCanyons = The readings are too erratic to learn anything.
		LeouchInSpaceHigh = Mainland = The moon is too far away to take readings.
		LeouchInSpaceHigh = FracturedLands = The gravity is hot here. maybe your looking at the wrong instrument.

		LeouchSrfLandedFracturedLands = The crust looks folded here.
