		LaveSrfLandedSlopes = Initial observations of the sample are that this planet is definitely not Kerbin.
		LaveSrfLandedLargerCraters = There appears to be liquid hidden slightly under the surface. While it appears to be similar to water, the taste-test Mission Control has ordered has you worried.
		LaveSrfLandedGiantBasins = The material in the craters appears to have been exposed to high temperature and pressure. This is consistent with them being formed by impacts.
		LaveSrfLandedCrateredSurface = Detailed analysis of this surface soil should allow KSC to easy identify the optimal holiday camp sites.
		LaveSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = It appears to be a tan-colored dust, supporting your hypothesis that the ridge comes from fallen ring material.

		LaveSrfLandedMt.Kilashi = You're glad your ship did the "climbing" for you, having to climb this massive mountain would be very tiring, especially in your bulky spacesuit.
		LaveSrfLandedKilashi'sCaldera = The ship is sinking into the burning hot basalt, you better get off here quickly.
		LaveSrfLandedSulferPlains = Who cut the cheese? It smells nasty out here.

		LaveSrfLandedLargerCraters = 
		LaveSrfLandedGiantBasins = The ground appears to have large fragments of brown rock. This might be an old asteroid that was captured by Lave.
		LaveSrfLandedCrateredSurface = Virgin Kalactic is looking to hopefully set up holiday camps here. They'll pay a lot for this data.
		LaveSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = You are sinking into the ground at a rapid pace, as it appears to be a very thin dust. Better activate the jetpack so you don't get trapped!
		LaveSrfLandedMt.Kilashi = Are we at the top yet? You're getting tired of climbing.
		LaveSrfLandedKilashi'sCaldera = The floor is lava! Literally!
		LaveSrfLandedSulferPlains = Yellow as far as the eye can see, with a little bit of purple. You wonder why nature chose such a garish color scheme for this planet.

		LaveSrfLandedSnowlands = The materials seem optimistic about being this far away from home.
		LaveSrfLandedSlopes = Some of the materials are giving you dirty looks. You'd feel more comfortable if they stopped whispering to each other.
		LaveSrfLandedLargerCraters = Unimpressed by the result you try smearing the samples on the ground. Mission control quickly asks just what you think you're doing.
		LaveSrfLandedGiantBasins = The view of the sheer size of the crater makes concentrating on the results difficult.
		LaveSrfLandedCrateredSurface = It's times like this you're glad you stuffed the materials lab full of snack when no one was watching.
		LaveSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = The dust comprising the ridge is getting all over the samples!
		LaveSrfLandedMt.Kilashi = The samples appear to be afraid of drops, and huddle far from the lab's doors.
		LaveSrfLandedKilashi'sCaldera = The sample are catching on fire!
		LaveSrfLandedSulferPlains = Some of the samples react with the sulfer, forming various green and white powders.

		LaveSrfLandedSnowlands = You're really cold... brrrrrr!
		LaveSrfLandedSlopes = As you try to decipher exactly what the thermometer is saying, your ships starts to slide down the hill. HURRY!
		LaveSrfLandedLargerCraters = The heavy gasses of the atmosphere seem to pool here, trapping pockets of heat.
		LaveSrfLandedGiantBasins = The thermometer seems cold, maybe you should bring it inside for a while.
		LaveSrfLandedCrateredSurface = The thermometer reads same temperatures as back on Kerbin. Surely you broke it somehow.
		LaveSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = It's cold up here, not much different from every other reading on Lave.
		LaveSrfLandedMt.Kilashi = The thermometer slowly rises the closer you get to the caldera.
		LaveSrfLandedKilashi'sCaldera = You would be checking the thermometer, but you don't really need it to know that it's burning hot right now.
		LaveSrfLandedSulferPlains = Despite being surrounded by brimstone, the scan indecates that it isn't any hotter here then the rest of lava.
		LaveFlyingLow = The display says '1337'. You get the feeling it's mocking you somehow.
		LaveFlyingHigh = Temperatures here fluctuate way more than you expected.
		LaveInSpaceLow = It's incredibly cold in space, but every once in a while the temperature rises slightly. You think that plumes of heat could be coming off the planet below.

		LaveSrfLandedSnowlands = The atmosphere is clearer here. It seems the toxic gasses pool close to the surface.
		LaveSrfLandedSlopes = You thought briefly about doing the experiment, but decided that would be boring.
		LaveSrfLandedLargerCraters = The barometer seems to be wheezing, you carefully check to make sure your helmet is fastened properly.
		LaveSrfLandedGiantBasins = The atmosphere here is very thin, but at least it's better than nothing!
		LaveSrfLandedCrateredSurface = The readings simply read 'ERROR'. You wonder what it could mean.
		LaveSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = There's very little atmosphere up here, just barely enough to not register as vacuum.
		LaveSrfLandedMt.Kilashi = The higher you are on the mountain, the barometer reading gets lower. Obviously.
		LaveSrfLandedKilashi'sCaldera = The atmospheric pressure is slightly higher in here then the altitude would suggest, due to the walls of the caldera trapping gasses inside.
		LaveSrfLandedSulferPlains = The atmosphere is thicker here, on the surface. You are unsuprised by this development.
		LaveFlyingLow = There may be an atmosphere, but breathing it is definitely not recommended.
		LaveFlyingHigh = The barometer is struggling to find any trace of a atmosphere here, perhaps you should check you're at the right place.

		LaveSrfLandedSnowlands = The results interest you greatly, it seems the snowy surface is hiding super-dense materials below.
		LaveSrfLandedSlopes = It seems the slopes only cause a small flicker on the instrument.
		LaveSrfLandedLargerCraters = The sensor seems to not be responding, you try hitting hit but only end up making things worse.
		LaveSrfLandedGiantBasins = Fluctuation in gravity can be detected, perhaps by the ultra-compressed surface beneath you.
		LaveSrfLandedCrateredSurface = The graviolis seem to be attracted to the surface of Lave, you suspect its the pretty coloring that does it.
		LaveSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = The gravity scan indicates that the ridge has an extremely low density, perhaps being mainly composed of dust.
		LaveSrfLandedMt.Kilashi = The huge mass of the mountain is easily registered on the scanner.
		LaveSrfLandedKilashi'sCaldera = You would be reading the scan, but you already know it's going to be basically the same as the rest of Lave, even in the middle of a volcano.
		LaveSrfLandedSulferPlains = The gravity scan shows nothing of interest, other then a constant 0.65g of gravity.
		LaveInSpaceLow = Judging from the readout, you begin to suspect that the planet beneath you has gravity.
		LaveInSpaceHigh = Readings show that the gravity of Lave is a lot lower than Kerbin. It seems the planet must be made from less dense materials.

	@RESULTS
	{
		LaveSrfLandedSnowlands = You're pretty sure from the readout that there's an earthquake about to occur, or maybe the ship is shaking again. You should check the landing gears.
		LaveSrfLandedSlopes = Normal seismic activity can be detected by the soil sliding down the hills.
		LaveSrfLandedLargerCraters = It appears from the readout that there's extensive underground caverns close to the bottom of the crater sites.
		LaveSrfLandedGiantBasins = The readout tells you not to worry, but you're not going to let a machine tell you what to do!
		LaveSrfLandedCrateredSurface = You detect a lot of tremors underground. You decide it's probably best to leave soon.
		LaveSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = The dust comprising the ridge appears to have a "damping" effect on the readings, with all of the seismic data from the planet's core being heavily muffled.
		LaveSrfLandedSulferPlains = The readout shows large seismic waves coming from that mountain off in the distance.
		LaveSrfLandedMt.Kilashi = Many quakes and tremors are detected coming from the volcano, indicating that it's very much active.
		LaveSrfLandedKilashi'sCaldera = As magma churns and whirls beneith you, the seismic readings become very unstable. You really hope an eruption isn't coming.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[atmosphereAnalysis]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		LaveSrfLandedSnowlands = Readings show so many ice particles in the air, that the sensor is becoming clogged. You contemplate fixing the device, but decide it's not worth the hassle.
		LaveSrfLandedSlopes = The atmosphere in this area is so thin that no meaningful readings can be detected, perhaps it's not worth trying elsewhere either.
		LaveSrfLandedLargerCraters = You run an analysis on the virtually non-existent atmosphere, only to fall asleep before the sensors finish.
		LaveSrfLandedGiantBasins = It seems there is very little nitrogen here, also very little of any other type of gas is being detected. Perhaps you forgot to turn the sensor on again.
		LaveSrfLandedCrateredSurface = It appears that the atmosphere on Lave is caused by chemical reactions in the surface soil. Perhaps it's better to watch your step out there.
		LaveSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = The atmosphere is so thin up here that the scanner instead shows you the composition of the dust stirred up while landing. Better land on the rest of the planet for a real reading.
		LaveSrfLandedSulferPlains = The analysis indecates the presence of oxygen! Oh wait, you have it set to the inside of the ship...
		LaveSrfLandedMt.Kilashi = The sulfer content rises the closer you get to the top.
		LaveSrfLandedKilashi'sCaldera = The composition of Mt. Kilashi's gasses appears to be mainly Carbon Dioxide, Sulfer Dioxide, and Hydrogen Sulfide. Not the best stuff to be breathing in.
		LaveFlyingLow = The atmosphere on Lave doesn't seem breathable, and it has a slightly odd smell. Virgin Kalactic's publicity team should be prepared before setting up their holiday resort.
		LaveFlyingHigh = There is no atmosphere detected at your current altitude, are you sure you're at the right planet?
