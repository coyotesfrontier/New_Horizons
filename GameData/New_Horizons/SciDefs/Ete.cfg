	{
		EteSrfLandedFlats = If Minmus is mint flavoured, is this moon blueberry?
		EteSrfLandedSlopes = A large sheet of ice, several meters in length, breaks off the slope. Despite mission controls orders, you try to place it in the sample container. It's fine if its hanging out of the bay, right?
		EteSrfLandedPeaks = You take a sample off the highest point of the tallest mountain, and hope it will be preserved in a museum somewhere on Kerbin.

	@RESULTS
	{
		EteInSpaceHigh = This moon has shrunk!
		EteInSpaceLow = You try to reach out and touch the mountains. Mission control is screaming at you to stop.
		EteSrfLandedFlats = That was a fairly easy landing!
		EteSrfLandedSlopes = You hope the spacecraft doesn't roll down the slope.
		EteSrfLandedPeaks = This doesn't seem stable.

	@RESULTS
	{
		EteInSpaceHigh = The blue colour reminds you of another planet. Laythe.
		EteInSpaceLowFlats = Rovers here would be so fun!
		EteInSpaceLowSlopes = If only Titanus was closer to Kerbin, Ete could have a thriving tourist industry!
		EteInSpaceLowPeaks = Whoa! Those mountains are a little close to us, aren't they!
		EteSrfLandedFlats = Just by jumping, the curvature of Ete is clearly visible!
		EteSrfLandedSlopes = Are these surfaces stable?
		EteSrfLandedPeaks = Its quite difficult to stay upright on these slopes!

		EteInSpaceHigh = The goo appears to mimic Ete.
		EteInSpaceLow = The goo is far more interested in Titanus than Ete.
		EteSrfLandedFlats = The goo is sleeping.
		EteSrfLandedSlopes = The goo goes skiing.
		EteSrfLandedPeaks = The goo balances on one of the peaks.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		EteInSpaceHigh = The samples don't notice Ete.
		EteInSpaceLow = A stapler floats out of the materials bay. Mortimer was wondering where that went!
		EteSrfLandedFlats = You realise that no blue samples were included in the materials bay. You place a sample of Ete inside, to rectify this.
		EteSrfLandedSlopes = You are disappointed that no skis were included.
		EteSrfLandedPeaks = Some of the samples roll down the slope, never to be seen again.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		EteInSpaceHigh = Ete is very cold, and doesn't appear to be active in any way.
		EteInSpaceLow = This moon appears to be completely inactive.
		EteSrfLandedFlats = It's very cold here.
		EteSrfLandedSlopes = The ice isn't emitting much heat.
		EteSrfLandedPeaks = More heat is coming from Titanus and Tylo than Ete.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		EteInSpaceHighFlats = This little moon doesn't have the biggest gravity field.
		EteInSpaceHighSlopes = It's difficult to make out anything from such a weak field.
		EteInSpaceHighPeaks = There is a possible mountain range down there.
		EteInSpaceLowFlats = This area seems remarkably smooth.
		EteInSpaceLowSlopes = Are these tectonic in nature!
		EteInSpaceLowPeaks = What business does this moon have in having tectonic landforms! Surely its too small for that!
		EteSrfLandedFlats = The gravity field is very bland here,
		EteSrfLandedSlopes = The mountains are causing a massive gravitational disruption.
		EteSrfLandedPeaks = The local gravity is, oddly, higher at this high altitude, due to the larger mass of the mountains.

		EteSrfLandedFlats = Ete appears geologically dead,

		EteSrfLandedPeaks = The faults that the uplift of these mountains created are being moved by Tylo's tides.
