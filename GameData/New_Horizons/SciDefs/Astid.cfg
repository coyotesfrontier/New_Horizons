		AstidSrfLandedDepths = As you scoop a sample into the container you become unnerved by the blood red color.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		AstidSrfLandedRockface = The view here is spectacular! You ask mission control if you can take a holiday here, but they quickly decline the request.
		AstidSrfLandedValley = The extreme swaying of the craft quickly takes away from the breathtaking views here. Perhaps landing on such a steep incline wasn't a smart idea!
		AstidSrfLandedDepths = You start to see red...
		
		AstidInSpaceLow = You are so close to the surface now that you feel you could just reach out and touch it.
		AstidInSpaceHigh = Those valleys look way too steep to land on, you start to look for a better spot to touch down.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		AstidSrfLandedRockface = The view takes your breath away, perhaps you should check your oxygen supply just to be safe.
		AstidSrfLandedValley = It's hard to tell what's happening as you slide down the rocky surface.
		AstidSrfLandedDepths = The blood red of the surface here gives you nightmarish flashbacks of horror movies. You think its probably best to get back inside the ship.
		
		AstidInSpaceLow = You try and reach out to touch the surface, but its only just out of reach.
		AstidInSpaceHigh = You don't know what you hoped to accomplish by stepping out of the capsule, but you're here now!

	{
		AstidSrfLandedRockface = The goo appears to be awestruck.
		AstidSrfLandedValley = The goo appears to be trying to be bracing itself from the steep fall.
		AstidSrfLandedDepths = The goo looks at you menacingly. With the ground resembling old horror movies, you quickly slam the cannister shut.
		AstidInSpaceLow = The reflection of Astid's surface can be seen in details on the surface of the goo.
		AstidInSpaceHigh = Nothing happens. Somehow, you feel disappointed although you didn't know what you expected.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		AstidSrfLandedRockface = The fine dust from the surface has gone all through the samples, making all the experiments unusable.
		AstidSrfLandedValley = The contents quickly fall out. Luckily the gravity is so low you manage to grab them as they gently float off.
		AstidSrfLandedDepths = The experiments show that this would make the perfect set for a slasher movie.
		AstidInSpaceLow = Nothing? You were sure the experiments would yield results this time!
		AstidInSpaceHigh = You don't expect much from the experiments here, so as they churn away you sneak in a quick nap.

	@RESULTS
	{
		AstidSrfLandedRockface = You didn't need to use the thermometer to see that this place is extremely cold!
		AstidSrfLandedValley = You try to glimpse at the readings, but decide keeping the craft from tumbling down the slope is more important.
		AstidSrfLandedDepths = The temperature hasn't changed at all.
		AstidInSpaceLow = Small slivers of heat can be detected radiating from Arin's surface from all the way out here.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		AstidSrfLandedRockface = You use the reading to try and work out if it would be possible to jump to Arin's surface from here.
		AstidSrfLandedValley = It seems the low gravity is the only thing making landing here viable.
		AstidSrfLandedDepths = This place has so little gravity you wonder why there is any at all!
		AstidInSpaceLow = It seems the detector is detecting something, fascinating!
		AstidInSpaceHigh = The detector looks like it's resting, best to not disturb it.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		AstidSrfLandedRockface = Scans show the interior composition of the planet is rather dull.
		AstidSrfLandedValley = You can't tell if the fluctuations are caused by Astid, or the ship scraping the slope as it tumbles down.
		AstidSrfLandedDepths = Nothing can be detected at all. It seems Astid is just a small hunk of rock, and nothing else.
