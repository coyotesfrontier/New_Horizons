	@RESULTS
	{
		SonnahFlyingLow = You open the door and in an instant all the materials spill out into the blue abyss, maybe you should've taken gravity in account.
		SonnahFlyingHigh = The samples take on a blueish hue, you wonder if it’s a real reaction or if they are just teasing you.
		SonnahInSpaceLow = As you examine the samples you notice one of them has grown eyes. You feel a little worried, until it winks at you reassuringly.
