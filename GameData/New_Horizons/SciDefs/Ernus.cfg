		ErnusSrfLandedWhiteFlows = You decide white hot molten rock is probably not safe to handle, and quickly decide going home empty handed will be easier.
		ErnusSrfLandedRidgelands = As the ground shifts uncomfortably under you, you decide it's time to get back on the ship.
		ErnusSrfLandedSurface = The sample here melts the container you put it into; maybe Tupperware wasn't the best choice.

		ErnusSrfLandedMeltedFace = You begin to get nervous when you notice just how big that sun is. 
		ErnusSrfLandedWhiteFlows = You feel amazed at what scientific findings this area will hold, like finding out the smell of a kerbal boiling inside his own capsule.
		ErnusSrfLandedRidgelands = Looking around you suddenly feel the urge to roll down one of those steep hills.
		ErnusSrfLandedSurface = The view from here makes you briefly forget just how much the sun was melting your ship.

		ErnusInSpaceLow = You notice the heat radiating from the planet is making the ship groan as you turn the air conditioning to its maximum.

		ErnusInSpaceHigh = You feel an odd calm as you accidentally start to stare at the sun, as if the light is enveloping you completely.

		ErnusSrfLandedWhiteFlows = Luckily, years of playing 'The floor is lava' as a young Kerbal has properly prepared you for this situation.
		ErnusSrfLandedRidgelands = As you get ready to roll down the hills, KSC quickly interrupts you telling you to stop.
		ErnusSrfLandedSurface = Its still unbearably hot out here, even in the shade!

		ErnusInSpaceLow = The heat is making you sweat into your suit, steaming up the visor.

		ErnusSrfLandedRidgelands = The goo starts spinning in place, looks like it has the same idea we have.
		ErnusSrfLandedSurface = The goo seems peaceful at last, it looks as if it's at home here.

		ErnusInSpaceLow = The goo shivers with excitement.

		ErnusInSpaceHigh = The canister springs open excitedly as you touch it, as if it’s happy to be here.

		ErnusSrfLandedMeltedFace = The experiments all seem to have melted in the container, you decide to call that a success.
		ErnusSrfLandedWhiteFlows = You realize now that you forgot to pack the keys to unlock the materials lab.
		ErnusSrfLandedRidgelands = The materials all fall out the door and roll down the hills, perhaps landing on such a steep slope wasn't such a great idea.
		ErnusSrfLandedSurface = The materials have all turned a red-orange color, you make a note that they don't taste very nice.

		ErnusInSpaceLow = The heat from the planet makes the experiments all burst into flame.

		ErnusSrfLandedWhiteFlows = All that’s left of the thermometer is a pile of ash. Pondering, you question whether 'ash' could be considered a temperature.
		ErnusSrfLandedRidgelands = The sides of the ridges out of the sunlight seem to be a much nicer temperature.
		ErnusSrfLandedSurface = Trying to tell the temperature is difficult seeing as the mercury inside the thermometer evaporated hours ago.

		ErnusInSpaceLow = It's hard to read the readout while the display is melting.

		ErnusInSpaceHigh = The electronic display attached to the thermometer just reads 'pls no!'
