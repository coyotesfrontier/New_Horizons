		NolasSrfLandedIcyHighlands = The sample dissolves all of your bags, so you just place it in the sample bay, confident it will be fine.
		NolasSrfLandedTectonicCracks = The sample looks like brown snow. I will say no more.
		NolasSrfLandedIcySurface = The ice is very hard and strong, and without letting Werner see, you simply place an empty bag in the sample box.

		NolasSrfLandedTectonicCracks = The landers legs are eroding in the pinkish deposits. Mission control doesn't think that this is important.
		NolasSrfLandedIcySurface = It's cold, and no-one wants to go on EVA.

		NolasInSpaceLow = How did all the kings horses and all the king's men put this back together?

		NolasInSpaceLowIcyHighlands = This area looks very smooth.
		NolasInSpaceLowTectonicCracks = This area does not look smooth, though!

		NolasInSpaceLowIcySurface = How do we land there?!
		NolasInSpaceHigh = Jeb. Jeb could be this clumsy.

		NolasSrfLandedTectonicCracks = Even though the entire planet is an ice-ball, Mortimer won't stop talking about how the winter of '68 was much worse.
		NolasSrfLandedIcySurface = The area inside the crack is almost hot enough to melt the ice, you don't understand why the ice didn't melt with the heat of the engine.

		NolasInSpaceLow = The heat emissions are are coming mainly from the highlands and the cracks.

		NolasInSpaceHigh = Nolas is giving off a little more heat than expected.

		NolasSrfLandedTectonicCracks = The cracks seem to distort the gravity of Nolas.
		NolasSrfLandedIcySurface = The surface is bobbing up and down, almost like an ice flow...

		NolasInSpaceLowIcyHighlands = Currents are detected inside an underground ocean, creating Nolas's magnetosphere.
		NolasInSpaceLowTectonicCracks = Denser water forms pipes extending almost to the surface, almost like Kerbin's volcanoes.
		NolasInSpaceLowIcySurface = The gravity here varies as water comes closer to and further away from the surface.

		NolasInSpaceHighIcyHighlands = The gravity indicates that Nolas is fully differentiated, with metal, rock, water and ice layers.
		NolasInSpaceHighTectonicCracks = This area has lower mass than the rest of Nolas.
		NolasInSpaceHighIcySurface = The gravity drops slightly as you pass over this area.
